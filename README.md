Essay Questions   

**1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?**   

I am interested in programming because it is a way to build beautiful things that positively impact peoples’ lives. Moreover, computers have become so woven into the fabric of society that a firm understanding of their properties and potential has become imperative. To expose myself to programming so far, I have completed several online tutorials such as HTML & CSS and Make an Interactive Website from Codecademy, and HTML & CSS and Intro to Javascript from Skillcrush. I especially enjoyed the courses from Skillcrush because it is a woman-centered community that offers video lectures and office hours with real instructors alongside the standard online coursework. Beyond tutorials, I have found mentors in my friends who work as developers, meeting with them frequently for advice and guidance in my projects.  


**2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?**   

In the next two years, I want to learn enough computer science and coding to become a full time developer. I want to work on challenging projects that build my skills but also produce creative solutions to complex problems. In 5 years, I’d like to have gained enough experience in the field to assume a leadership role and tackle bigger and more intricate problems with talented colleagues. I also aspire to have enough confidence in my work that I am able to take on freelance projects and devote time to personal pursuits. Lastly, I feel strongly that there need to be more women in STEM professional fields. I’d use my skills and experience as a developer to encourage and help women entering the field.


**3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**   

In the year after I graduated college, I accepted a job as a Sales Associate at a well-known business review website. Though not directly related to my studies at Bard College, which were focused on politics and international affairs, I thought the tech start-up culture paired with the sizable salary being offered to me would keep me interested and happy… wrong! Quickly into my employment, it became clear that this company and I were not a good fit. Primarily, the company’s business model centered around squeezing as much money out of small business owners as possible by any means possible, including deception. This required Sales Associates to make outlandish and fact-less claims to convince small business owners to buy. Doing so made me sick to my stomach and I quit within 2 months; however, the experience has been one of my most formative professionally because it made clear that I much prefer to work in an environment that values integrity, purpose, and creativity over purely financial gains. Since then, whenever I am confronted with new employment opportunities I am sure to closely evaluate the nature of the work, seeking positions that better people’s lives and provide a creative outlet.    


**4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.**   

A year out of college, I was hired to be a Post Production Assistant for two new TV shows. The first couple of months on the job were great-- I was making meaningful contributions to the team and learning a lot about production and TV development-- but then the Post Supervisor of my shows was fired. She was my direct boss and the head of post for both shows. Instantly, I became the person who knew the most about the shows. Though I was only two months into assisting on the show, I had to step up and assume the role of Post Supervisor, a senior position that normally requires years of experience. Though intimidated, I approached the opportunity with optimism and gave it my best shot. I reached out to the people on my team to learn about their roles and schedules so that I could better coordinate them; I sought advice from other Post Supervisors on how they ran their shows to understand how to structure mine. At first it was challenging to be the point person for so many people, but quickly I learned how to manage the workflow. Several months later, the network hired a new Post Supervisor with the experience required to finish the show, but having shown my ability to perform under pressure and rise to the occasion, I was promoted to coordinator from assistant.
